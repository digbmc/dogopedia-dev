Sasha Sokolov is one of the best-known Russian authors of the second half of the twentieth century. His work has significantly influenced the development of contemporary Russian literature, and most authors openly recognize the role Sokolov’s oeuvre has played on their creative formation and maturation. His three novels—A School for Fools (1976), Between Dog and Wolf (1980), and Palisandriia (1985, translated as Astrophobia)—embody the author’s idiosyncratic and peculiar style, a feature that has challenged translators and critics for decades. 

His second novel, for example, had to wait until 2017 to appear in English, thanks to the efforts of Alexander Boguslawski. Perceiving the amount of what was lost in the process of rendering Sokolov’s text into another language, the translator felt the need to include selected explanatory endnotes; these notes range from comments on the original Russian to explanations of wine varieties mentioned in the text. More recently, Boris Ostanin has authored a [Russian-language glossary](https://www.labirint.ru/books/763563/) to the novel, which provides useful, if idiosyncratic, interpretations of many critical semantic points.  

However, both projects have serious limitations. Ostanin’s glossary, which was published in a very small run, is intended for a highly educated Russian reader, and it’s not suitable for use in the classroom or, of course, for a non- Russian audience. On the other hand, Boguslawski’s commentary is clearly meant for a general reader, but for this reason, it also lacks the depth of analysis and breadth of approach that a student, for example, would need in approaching the novel in either language. In some cases, as Sokolov himself has noted, there are factual and interpretive errors in both of these volumes. 

The *Encyclopedia of the Dog* project aims to overcome the lack of suitable tools necessary to enter Sokolov’s complex literary world by providing a complete and freely accessible bilingual digital edition of *Between Dog and Wolf*. This digital edition displays Sokolov's novel in both Russian and English, accompanied by multiple layers of annotation to help readers grasp the various meanings, allusions, and layers of the text.
